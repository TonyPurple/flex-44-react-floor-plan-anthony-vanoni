I took a couple of creative liberties for further practice of defining components and drilling props, but all minimum requirements for the lab are complete.
Specifically, I ordered the rooms slightly differently, added a fridge and freezer to the kitchen including some food items as props, added an extra bath, I also worked on adding styling for specific components and chose to work on CSS grid.
I wanted to have some fun beyond the minimum requirements, so it's a little bit whacky.
I like to imagine Bedroom #3 as a tunnel, and it opens into bedroom 2, where there is like a chalkline drawn to separate the 2 rooms like you'd do when you were sharing a bedroom with a sibling and got in a fight.
